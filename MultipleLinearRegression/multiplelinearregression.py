Assumptions of Linear Regression
- Linearity (Linear Relationship between Y and each X)
- Homoscedasticity (Equal variance , there should not be any cone at any end)
- Multivariate Normality (Normality of error distribution)
- Independence (of observations includes "no autocorrelation ie htere should not any pattern in data that you can see)
- Lack of Multicollinearity ( predictors are npot corelated to each other)
- The Outlier Check ( Not assumptions but extra)
